        <h1>Hi ! I am Sudeep.</h1> 
        <p>I am a student currently taking Master of Computing and Data Analytics 
        program at Saint Mary's University. I also work as a Service Desk Analyst 
        at RBC. Apart from work and academics, I love to listen to music, travel, 
        and read. 
        <br /> <br />
        I joined the MCDA program at SMU for furthering my career in the Software
        Development and Data Analytics field. The program fits my needs and schedule
        perfectly and it's a professional degree designed for providing industry 
        standard education and experience which can be really beneficial for the 
        career path I have planned for myself. 
        </p>
